# Notebooks for generation of draft figures and visualizaitons

## Compare FOUNDIN-PD da65 SCRN-DA to HipSci day 52 SCRN-DA eQTL and FOUNID RNAB to HipSci SCRN pseudo bulk; figures/compare_foundin_hipsci.ipynb

## Visualization of PD risk and QTL colocalization results as a heatmap; figures/colocalization_results_heatmap.ipynb

## Plot feature specific QTL and PD risk results; figures/feature_specific_qtl_results.ipynb and figures/pm_run_feature_specific_qtl_results.ipynb

## Visualize cell-type importance based on colocalziation between PD risk and cell-specific eQTL; figures/cell_enrichment_risk_qtl_colocaliation.ipynb
  
## Generate the GSEA Enrichr results for the specified colocalizations results and enrichment libraries; figures/gsea_enrichr.ipynb




figures/cell_pathway_sankey.ipynb is dependent on gsea stuff
